The Australian Constitution is the fundamental law of Australia that governs the country's government. It was drafted in the 1890s by representatives of the colonies and was approved by the people of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania. The Constitution was passed as part of a British Act of Parliament in 1900 and took effect on 1 January 1901. The Constitution establishes a federal system of government, where powers are distributed between a central government and regional governments. The Constitution confers the legislative, executive, and judicial powers of the Commonwealth on three different bodies, the Parliament, the Executive Government, and the Judicature. The head of state of Australia is a monarch whose functions are regulated by the Constitution. The Governor-General performs a large number of functions, but apart from exceptional circumstances, the Governor-General acts in accordance with the advice of Commonwealth Ministers. The Constitution established the Commonwealth Parliament comprising the Queen, a House of Representatives, and a Senate. Before a proposed law becomes an Act, it must be passed by both Houses of Parliament and receive Royal Assent from the Governor-General.

The Australian Constitution outlines the powers and functions of the Commonwealth Parliament, State Parliaments, Executive Government, and Federal Judicature. To become an Act of Parliament, a Bill must be passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate and receive assent from the Governor-General. The Commonwealth Parliament has limited powers, which are listed in sections 51 and 52, and include defence, taxation, and immigration. The State Parliaments can make laws on any subject relevant to their particular state, except for a few exceptions. The Commonwealth is generally regarded as the more powerful partner in the federation, and if a valid Commonwealth law is inconsistent with a law of a State Parliament, the Commonwealth law operates. The Executive Government of the Commonwealth functions in accordance with the principle of responsible government, and the Governor-General acts in accordance with advice from the Ministers of the Government. The Federal Judicature includes the High Court of Australia, which has the power to interpret the Constitution and decide disputes about the meaning of the Constitution. Chapter IV of the Constitution regulates trade and commerce throughout Australia, and section 92 prohibits action by either the Commonwealth or a State which discriminates against interstate trade or commerce.
